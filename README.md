Resistors 470 Ω 560 Ω 1 K Ω 2 1 1

Bread board --- 1

Multimeter --- 1

THEORY:

THEVENIN’S THEOREM:

Thevenin’s theorem states that, ‘a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source, VTh (= Voc) in series with a resistor RTh, where VTh is the open-circuit voltage at the load terminals and RThis the input or equivalent resistance at the load terminals( AB) when the independent sources are turned off’.

Thevenin’s Voltage, VTh:

It is the open-circuit voltage across the load terminals (AB). i.e., VTh = Voc

Thevenin’s Resistance, RTh:

It is the look-back resistance across the load terminals when all the sources are replaced by their internal resistances. An ideal voltage source is replaced by short- circuiting as its internal resistance is zero. An ideal current source is replaced by open- circuiting as its internal resistance is infinity.

PROCEDURE:

Make the connections as per the Circuit Diagram:1

Vary the RPS and set an input voltage of 10V.

Note down the voltmeter reading (Vi) and ammeter reading (IL) in Tabular Column 1.

Switch off the supply and make connections for Circuit Diagram 2.

Measure the Thevenin’s resistance RTh= Norton’s resistance RN .

Switch off the supply and make connections for Circuit Diagram:3.

Set an input voltage of 10V in the RPS and note down the voltmeter readings Vi and VTh(=Voc) in Tabular Column:3

Switch off the supply and make connections for Circuit Diagram 4.

Set an input voltage of 10V in the RPS and note down the voltmeter reading Vi and Ammeter reading IN (= Isc) in Tabular Column 4.

Draw the Thevenin’s equivalent circuit and Nortons’s equivalent circuit as shown in circuit diagrams 5 & 6 respectively.

Calculate the IL value using the formula Thevenin’s Theorem IL = VTh/ ( RTh+ R L) Norton’s Theorem IL = IN * RN / ( RN + RL )

Theoretically verify the Norton’s theorem.
